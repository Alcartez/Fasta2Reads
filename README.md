# Fasta2Reads
Amplify Fasta file Data to get reads.
It is just a python script.

Installation and usage:
1. Clone the repository like every responsible being should
2. Just run it as it is for the sample.
3. Now if you want to use your own fasta file to create reads , remove the predefined input file and uncomment the next line that allows user input
4. Do the same if you want to change the number of loops (default 100)

Things to keep in mind : 
1. Make sure the input file is in same directory as the script to run it.
2. If the input file is not in the same directory as the script then enter the complete path of the input file instead of just the file name.
